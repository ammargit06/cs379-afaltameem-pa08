PA 8: The VTable Dispatcher -- starter.

Complete VTable, build_vtable, USIObject, and dispatch below. See
PA_08_The_VTable_Dispatcher.md, Part B, for the full requirements.

Each table entry follows PA 7's Closure.call(args, caller_env) interface.
The harness supplies small closure-like methods so it can test dispatch
without adding string literals to the earlier interpreter grammar. Your
dispatch implementation must invoke .call with the receiver as the first
argument, followed by the explicit method arguments.
